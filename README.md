# Chatbot Testing Suite

This repository provides a testing suite for a custom Chatbot model implemented in Python. It uses **pytest** to perform unit tests for input validation, tokenization, and response generation.

## Features

- Validates user input by removing symbols and truncating long text.
- Tests tokenization of processed input using PyTorch tensors.
- Ensures generated responses are of expected length.
- Checks consistency of responses across multiple calls.
